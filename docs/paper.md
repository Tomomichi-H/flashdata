## Detailed Design

FlashData's innovative design is underpinned by three key elements: Oracle Nodes, Aggregator Services, and Integration with the Bitcoin and Lightning Network. Each component plays a vital role in ensuring the system's overall reliability, speed, and privacy.

### Oracle Nodes

At the foundation of the FlashData network are Oracle Nodes. Each Oracle Node is, at its core, a node on the Lightning Network that offers specialized data services. These nodes respond to data queries, provide the requested data, and in return, receive payments over the Lightning Network.

Oracle Nodes are independent, each serving their own data feeds without needing to reach a consensus with other nodes. They make their services known either publicly or privately to known-interested parties. As part of the data service, each node is responsible for generating Taproot signatures for their responses, facilitating the usage of this data across various blockchains without each node having to individually support those chains.

### Aggregator Services
Aggregator Services act as hubs in the FlashData's many-hub-and-spoke model. These services allow Oracle Nodes to register with them, displaying the Node's capabilities such as what data it supports, from which data sources, the data format, and the frequency of updates.

Aggregator Services aggregate data from multiple Oracle Nodes, enabling end-users to access a diverse range of data points from a single source. For users requesting data, these services also add a layer of security and privacy, anonymizing requests to Oracle Nodes.

When an Oracle Node adds a new data point, it pays a deposit to the Aggregator Service. The Aggregator Service uses this deposit to verify the accuracy and reliability of the data provided by the Node, thus ensuring the quality of the data feeds.

#### Interchain Operations and Incentivization

Aggregator Services in FlashData have a significant role to play in enabling the network to bridge with other blockchains. Beyond merely aggregating and verifying data from Oracle Nodes, these services are also capable of acting as a data conduit for other networks. Utilizing their own private keys, Aggregator Services can sign aggregated data, allowing it to be used across various blockchains without burdening individual Oracle Nodes to support these chains.

This cross-chain capability extends to the provision of off-chain APIs designed for dApps. These APIs serve as a streamlined interface for dApps to retrieve signed, aggregated data quickly and efficiently. Furthermore, Aggregator Services have the ability to directly write transactions on other blockchains that require and are willing to pay for this service. This multi-network operation can significantly streamline cross-chain communication and data transfer, providing a seamless user experience.

This broad interoperability is key for bootstrapping the network and maintaining its growth over time. With the promise of usage across multiple chains, Oracle Nodes have strong incentives to participate and maintain high-quality service. At the same time, it opens a profitable path for Aggregator Services, offering them an opportunity to operate reliably across various networks, thereby fostering a robust, reliable, and diversified oracle network.

#### Enabling User-Supplied Signed Data Validation

Aggregator Services in FlashData provide an important interface between dApps and their end-users, facilitating more sophisticated interactions and operations. One such operation is the ability to supply user-signed data in transactions that can be validated on a smart-contract-enabled blockchain.

To facilitate this, an Aggregator Service would provide the dApp with a signed piece of aggregated data. This signed data can then be incorporated into a transaction by an end-user. When the transaction is sent to a smart-contract-enabled blockchain, the included signed data can be validated directly by the smart contract in question.

This process enables a more dynamic interaction between the end-user and the smart contract, as it allows for the secure and verifiable inclusion of real-time, externally-sourced data in the transaction. This can enrich the functionality of smart contracts, enabling a wider range of use-cases.

Moreover, because the data is signed by the Aggregator Service, it provides a reliable assurance of the data's origin and integrity, ensuring that only valid and authorized data is incorporated into transactions. This not only enhances the security of the transaction but also helps prevent potential manipulation or misinformation, thereby contributing to the overall trustworthiness of the network.

#### Data Quality Assurance and Customizable Payment Options

In the FlashData ecosystem, Aggregator Services act as vital gatekeepers, performing a crucial role in data quality assurance. By aggregating data from multiple Oracle Nodes, they create an opportunity to perform quality checks and data sanitization. They can discard outlier responses, which may deviate significantly from the norm, thereby preserving the quality of data that is presented to the end-users.

This data validation process is not one-size-fits-all and allows room for customization, which may differentiate one Aggregator Service from another. For instance, an Aggregator Service could implement custom calculations or algorithms to filter the data or to spot and eliminate anomalies. This ability to refine and customize the data validation process allows Aggregator Services to carve out their unique value proposition, thereby fostering a competitive and innovative marketplace for data aggregation.

In addition to data quality control, Aggregator Services also offer flexible payment options. This flexibility can extend to accepting multiple forms of payment, whether it's Bitcoin via the Lightning Network, other cryptocurrencies, or even fiat currencies via payment processors. Such versatility in payment options broadens the appeal of the Aggregator Services, catering to a wide range of customer preferences and needs, and ultimately promoting wider adoption and use of the FlashData network.

### Integration with Bitcoin and Lightning Network

FlashData is deeply integrated with Bitcoin and the Lightning Network. Oracle Nodes form a part of the Lightning Network, making use of its fast and low-cost micro-transactions for payment. By providing data services over the Lightning Network, FlashData leverages the established and robust infrastructure of Bitcoin's second layer, saving the need for a separate P2P network.

Payments from data users to Oracle Nodes are made over the Lightning Network, with instant settlement. This, combined with the Taproot signatures of Oracle Nodes, means that the FlashData network can support a multitude of blockchain and off-chain applications without the need for each node to individually support these platforms.

The combination of Oracle Nodes and Aggregator Services, operating over the Lightning Network, allows FlashData to offer a fast, secure, and scalable decentralized oracle network. The structure enables a competitive and efficient marketplace for oracle services, which is key to fostering the kind of quality and reliability that end-users expect in a decentralized oracle network.

### Interaction Between Oracle Nodes and Aggregator Services

FlashData's Oracle Nodes and Aggregator Services use a payment protocol similar to the PAID API protocol outlined by SuredBits. In the context of FlashData, this protocol enables secure, fair, and efficient communication and transaction between the two parties. Here is an overview of how this process occurs:

1. Connection and Service Discovery: An Oracle Node connects to an Aggregator Service, sharing its services (data points it can provide), data sources, supported data format, and update frequency.

2. Invoice Request: When an Aggregator Service requires data from an Oracle Node, it sends a request for a Lightning Network invoice to the Oracle Node. This invoice request specifies the required data and the conditions under which it should be provided.

3. Invoice Response: The Oracle Node responds with a Lightning Network invoice. This invoice specifies the amount to be paid for the requested data.

4. Payment: The Aggregator Service reviews the invoice. If it agrees to the terms, it fulfills the invoice through the Lightning Network, which provides near-instant payment to the Oracle Node.

5. Data Provision: Upon receiving the payment, the Oracle Node sends the requested data to the Aggregator Service. The data is delivered along with a proof that it's the data specified in the invoice (through a preimage of a hash that was included in the invoice).

This interaction ensures that the Oracle Node is compensated for the data it provides while protecting the Aggregator Service from paying for incorrect or unrequested data. It's a balanced system that benefits both parties.

It's important to note that this process is highly flexible. The invoice can contain terms that are as simple or as complex as needed. For instance, it can specify the timeframe in which the data should be delivered, the format of the data, or even conditions related to the content of the data itself. This flexibility enables Oracle Nodes and Aggregator Services to establish agreements that suit their specific needs and preferences.

### Real-time Data Updates: Websockets and Lightning Network Channels

To facilitate low-latacy, real-time data updates, FlashData's Aggregator Services and Oracle Nodes can establish a websocket connection, an established technology for persistent, real-time, two-way communication between network nodes. The combination of websocket technology with direct Lightning Network channels creates an efficient and cost-effective solution for live data feed.

Here's a detailed overview of the process:

1. Websocket Connection: An Aggregator Service and an Oracle Node establish a websocket connection, enabling real-time communication. The Oracle Node can now push real-time data updates to the Aggregator Service as they happen.

2. Direct Lightning Channel: The Oracle Node and Aggregator Service open a direct channel on the Lightning Network. This connection serves as a dedicated payment pathway for the Oracle Node's data provision service.

3. Live Data Provision: As data updates occur, the Oracle Node pushes the new data to the Aggregator Service over the websocket connection. Each piece of data can be accompanied by a Lightning Network invoice for the corresponding service fee.

4. Real-time Payment: Upon receiving each data update, the Aggregator Service fulfills the provided invoice through the direct Lightning Network channel. This ensures real-time payment for the Oracle Node.

With direct Lightning Network channels, transaction fees can be minimal, potentially even zero, due to the absence of intermediaries. This allows the Oracle Node and Aggregator Service to transact micro-payments, which aligns well with the pay-per-data-update model.

This combination of websockets and Lightning Network channels enables FlashData to support real-time data feeds while ensuring fair and instant payment for Oracle Nodes. It also reduces the overheads associated with each transaction, making it a cost-effective solution for frequent, small payments.

By using this approach, FlashData can offer real-time data services, further enhancing the utility and versatility of the network. For applications where timely data is critical, such as high-frequency trading or real-time analytics, this feature could be invaluable.
