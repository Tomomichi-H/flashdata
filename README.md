# FlashData

FlashData is a decentralized oracle network, designed to provide real-time data services in a trustless, secure, and privacy-centric manner. Built on the robustness of the Bitcoin blockchain and the Lightning Network, FlashData aims to create an ecosystem where real-world data can be seamlessly integrated with blockchain-based applications, providing immense utility across a wide array of use cases.

## Overview

FlashData employs an innovative model of Oracle Nodes and Aggregator Services. Oracle Nodes are responsible for sourcing and providing data, while Aggregator Services act as an interface between the Oracle Nodes and the end-users or applications, ensuring quality, privacy, and security.

The network leverages the power of Bitcoin's Taproot for enhanced privacy and Lightning Network's efficiency for instant microtransactions. This not only enables the provision of real-time data feeds but also ensures that Oracle Nodes are paid instantly for their services.

With a keen focus on privacy, security, and quality, FlashData stands as a compelling solution for blockchain-based applications in need of reliable, real-time external data.
